Developing a tailor shop web application using Bootstrap for the front-end, Angular for the client-side application, and Spring Boot for the back-end is a comprehensive task that involves both design and development. 
Here's a general roadmap to help you get started:

1. Project Setup:
Set up your development environment for both front-end and back-end development.
Install Node.js and Angular CLI for the Angular part.
Set up Spring Boot project using Spring Initializr.

2. Front-End Development with Bootstrap and Angular:
Design the user interface using HTML and Bootstrap CSS classes.
Use Angular components, modules, and services for structuring the front-end.
Create components for different sections of the tailor shop application: home, products, services, contact, etc.
Implement responsive design using Bootstrap to ensure the application looks good on various devices.

3. Back-End Development with Spring Boot:
Define the data models for the tailor shop's products, services, customer information, etc.
Create RESTful APIs using Spring Boot's @RestController annotations.
Implement business logic and connect to a database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) using Spring Data JPA.
Set up security measures like authentication and authorization using Spring Security.

4. Integrating Front-End with Back-End:
Use Angular's HttpClient to make API requests to the Spring Boot back-end.
Implement form submissions, data retrieval, and other interactions between the front-end and back-end.

5. Additional Features:
Implement a user authentication system for customers and staff members.
Allow customers to place orders for tailoring services or products.
Include an admin dashboard for managing products, services, and orders.
Provide search and filter functionalities for products and services.

6. Testing and Debugging:
Test your application thoroughly on different devices and browsers to ensure cross-browser compatibility.
Debug any issues that arise during testing.

7. Deployment:
Deploy the Angular front-end on a web server or a cloud platform (e.g., Firebase, Netlify).
Deploy the Spring Boot back-end on a server or a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Heroku).
Configure domain and server settings as required.

8. Continuous Improvement:
Gather user feedback and make necessary improvements.
Keep the application up to date with the latest versions of Angular, Bootstrap, and Spring Boot.
Remember that this is a high-level overview, and the actual implementation might involve more detailed steps and considerations. 
You can find various tutorials, documentation, and online resources for each technology to guide you through the development process.

Good luck with your tailor shop web application project!
